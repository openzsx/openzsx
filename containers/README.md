# Containerized Workloads
This is all about workloads that run in ```s390x``` Docker containers - either
on Linux, or in a z/OS Container Extension (IBM zCX).  These kinds of images can
be developed and deployed in either environment interchangeably.  For this reason,
Dockerfiles posted here can be docker-built either on Linux, or from within the
zcx_dev container image.
