_**A Public Square for Open Source on IBM Z Systems**_

# The Open Z Systems Exchange
Welcome to the exchange.  Learn more about bringing your Linux-based open source
project to an IBM Z Systems mainframe.

This is a community of developers, architects, system administrators, and users
who share a common interest in the IBM Z open source ecosystem.  Along with a
practical set of infrastructure and knowledge, you will find tools and projects
that are useful for IBM Z deployments.  The resources here are relevant for users
of both z/OS and Linux/LinuxONE.  

Everyone is welcome.  If you have a Linux background, most of this will feel very
familiar.  If you have mainframed for years, the content here should help you
understand the Linux world in a recognizable context.

This repository is organized as follows:
- [containers](./containers/README.md) - resources for creating Docker images that
deploy on z/OS and Linux
- [ports](./ports/README.md) - resources for code that has been ported directly
to z/OS Unix System Services
- [platform](./platform/README.md) - useful tools and information for using the
IBM Z Systems platform, regardless of operating system
- [community](https://github.com/openzsx/community) - information about how the
community operates, how to contribute, and how to become a member
