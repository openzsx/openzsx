# The Open Z Systems Exchange
Welcome to the exchange.  This is where you can get help to bring your open
source project to a IBM Z Systems mainframe.

This is a community of developers, system administrators, and users who
share a common interest in the mainframe ecosystem of projects, tools, and
infrastructure, and knowledge.  The resources here are relevant to for users of
both z/OS and Linux/LinuxONE.

This community shares a common interest with the members of the
[Zowe project](https://github.com/zowe).  However, the focus here is on bringing
open source projects that have been developed for other environments to one of the
IBM Z Systems platforms.

Everyone is welcome.  You don't have to be a hardcore mainframer to be a member of
our community.

This repository is organized as follows:
- [containers](./containers/README.md) - resources for creating Docker images that
deploy on z/OS and Linux
- [ports](./ports/README.md) - resources for code that has been ported directly
to z/OS Unix System Services
- [platform](./platform/README.md) - useful tools and information for using the
IBM Z Systems platform, regardless of operating system
- [community](./community/README.md) - information about how the community
operates, how to contribute, and how to become a member
