# The Open Z Systems Exchange
Welcome to the exchange.  This is where you can get help to bring your open
source project to a IBM Z Systems mainframe.

This is a community of developers, system administrators, and users who
share a common interest in the mainframe ecosystem of projects, tools, and
infrastructure, and knowledge.  The resources here are relevant to for users of
both z/OS and Linux/LinuxONE.

This community shares a common interest with the members of the
[Zowe project](https://github.com/zowe).  However, the focus here is on bringing
projects that have been developed for other platforms to one of the IBM Z Systems
platforms.

Everyone is welcome.  You don't have to be a hardcore mainframer to be a part of
this community.
